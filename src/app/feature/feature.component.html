<ul *ngFor="let unit of idsAndColors">
    <li>Id: {{unit.id}}, Color: {{unit.color}}</li>
</ul>

<!-- Using the xmlData.xml file in Interview/config, display all the units on a map
Use any mapping framework you would like (e.g. leaflet).
Each Unit should display its ID and Color.
Allow the user to select a Range value.
Highlight untis that are within that range of any other unit.
Other Pages may wish to use your display code for the Unit.
Ensure that the feature page is responsive. -->
